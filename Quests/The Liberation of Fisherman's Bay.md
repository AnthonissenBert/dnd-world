Introduction:
The coastal village of Fisherman's Bay has been enslaved by a group of ruthless whale hunters who have taken over the area. The players are a group of adventurers who have heard about the plight of the village and have decided to take action. They arrive at the village just as the sun begins to set, and they can see the shadowy figures of the whale hunters moving about.

Plot:
As the players approach the village, they are met by a group of fishermen who have managed to escape the clutches of the whale hunters. The fishermen explain that the whale hunters have taken over the village and are using the villagers as slaves to help them hunt whales. They also mention that the whale hunters have a large ship that they use to transport their catch.

The players have two options: they can either attack the whale hunters head-on or try to sneak onto their ship and take it over. If they decide to attack the whale hunters, they will have to face off against a group of heavily armed hunters, as well as a few powerful wizards who are aiding the whale hunters.

If they decide to sneak onto the ship, they will have to avoid the whale hunters and their guard dogs. Once on the ship, they will have to fight their way through the crew to reach the captain's quarters. Once they have defeated the captain and his crew, they will need to decide what to do with the ship and the whale hunters.

Conclusion:
After the players have defeated the whale hunters, they will need to decide what to do with the ship and the freed villagers. If they decide to keep the ship, they can use it to transport goods and people along the coast. If they decide to give it back to the fishermen, they will be hailed as heroes and will be able to call on the fishermen for help in the future.

Regardless of their decision, the players will have liberated Fisherman's Bay and put an end to the whale hunters' reign of terror. The villagers will be grateful for their help, and the players will have gained a reputation as heroes along the coast.
