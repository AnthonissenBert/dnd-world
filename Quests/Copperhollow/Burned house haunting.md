level: 7

encounters:
- [[Lord Lurken]]

in short:
- one of the old guys at the miners guild in [[towns/small towns/mining settements/Copperhollow]] tells the adventurers party about a haunted burnt down building
- upon arriving it lookes like it is burned down
- when venturing deeper and roling high enough it's a major illusion
- when rolled low they're pushed out


in long:
The players approach the old group in the miners guild in [[towns/small towns/mining settements/Copperhollow]] who tells them about a burned down house in the neighborhood that is rumored to be haunted. The resident believes that something valuable may have been left behind in the house before the fire and asks the players to investigate.

Upon arriving at the house, the players discover that the house is indeed burned down and the neighborhood is avoiding the area due to the rumors of it being haunted. The players may notice that there are no signs of ghosts or other supernatural activity, but upon successfully entering the building (high enough wisdom saving throw) they find it to be inhabited by [[Lord Lurken]]. A collector of magical artifacts.

If the party wants they get a fetch quest to retrieve a certain artifact in the [[towns/small towns/mining settements/Copperhollow]] mines

If not they magically get kicked out
