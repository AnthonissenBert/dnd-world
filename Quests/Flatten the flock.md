in long
Objective: A flock of ravens has been spotted flying over the farming village of [[towns/small towns/farming settlements/Ravenswatch]]. The villagers are worried as the birds are not native to the area and are behaving erratically. The villagers have asked the party to investigate the flock and find out why they are flying over the village.

Background: The village of Ravenswood is known for its bountiful crops and peaceful inhabitants. However, in recent days, a large flock of ravens has been spotted flying over the village. The birds are not native to the area and are behaving erratically, causing concern among the villagers. Some believe that the birds are a sign of bad luck, while others believe that they are a harbinger of something more sinister.

Step 1: The party must first speak to the villagers to gather information about the flock of ravens. They can speak to the village elder, who will provide them with some background information about the birds. They can also speak to the local farmers, who will tell them about the birds' behavior and any damage they may have caused to the crops.

Step 2: The party must then venture out into [[Silverbark forest]] to search for the flock of ravens. They will encounter the flock flying overhead and will notice that the birds are indeed behaving erratically. They will also notice that there is a larger crow flying among the flock.

Step 3: The party must track the flock and the larger crow to their roosting site. An old elven ruin.

Step 4: Upon investigating the ruin, the party will discover that the larger crow is actually a shape-shifting sorcerer who has been using magic to control the flock of ravens. The sorcerer has been using the birds to scout the village and its surroundings as part of a larger plan to plunder the village's resources.

Step 5: The party must defeat the sorcerer and his minions to stop his plan and save the village.
